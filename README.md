# PCSelector

This project is a course work for a university course. Its goal is to automate the process of finding PC components based on user requirements.

The application prompts the user to input the necessary specifications and budget for their build. Then, it suggests the best options from the available components in the "components" folder.

To use the application, make sure the "components" folder is located next to the executable file.

Example component descriptions can be found in the "components" folder.
